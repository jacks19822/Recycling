<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Batteries are made of hazardous components and toxic chemicals that can be released into our environment if they are not properly disposed of. Recycling your old and used batteries ensures that our soil stays clean and undisturbed from battery waste. <br>
<br>
Did you know that almost 100% of a lead acid battery can be reused? Recycling keeps us from using up the Earth's limited resources and keeps CO2 emissions low. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Batteries are an important part of our day to day lives. From cell phones to cars, we use batteries to power our on the go lifestyle. But just as we must be responsible as to how we use batteries, we must also be responsible in how we handle these batteries after they are of no use to us.</span></p>
